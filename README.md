This repository serves as a supplementary material for the lab project at University of Groningen. Here, you can find our code, models, results and additional figures.

## Structure

1. `data` - the data we used for training and evaluating the networks
2. `models` - all four evaluated models
3. `result` - all error and performance plots for each model
4. `tuning` - supplementary results for the hyperparameter tuning
